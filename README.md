# react-test-1
Web-Development assignment:
Please create a repository named "react-test-1" on your github account.

Build a working chat app for multiple users with multiple users (many to many).

1. Use React-Virtualized (for list component) - both users list on left side and chat list will be done using this.
2. Semantic-UI-react (for a nice UI). No need to spend time writing your own CSS for beautification.
3. Pusher.com (as an easy way to get chat api). No need to set up your own socket.io . This is where you figure out how to use the Pusher API to get many-to-many chat working.
4. Extra brownie points - serviceworker (to show an alert in case  of app going offline)
